An interesting idea to avoid spammers is to make every action costly.

Each participants has some points, and every time they write a post or a comment a proposal he invests some points on it. Every time someone likes his idea, they add one point (out of their stack). Every time someone dislikes a post they steal one point from the stack. When the stac k goes to zero the proposal becomes invisible.

# Positive elements

It would avoid people from writing useless posts or comments. Comments like: "yes!", "that is great!" only add to the confusion and make it harder to find comments that really add something to the idea. Making them costly would stop that.

# Negative elements

The point of view of minorities could become invisible, as the majority would just silence them.

# Conclusions

Like this would not work. But maybe something more complex would. What is important is that a group of users are not allowed to just vote each other up, with the effect of producing more points.

Maybe the post would not get invisible, just it would become harder and harder to see them.

This would work particularly well in a context in which proposals are picked at random. Maybe with a weighted random, with the weight depending on the number of points. But again the number of points should not go to zero...
