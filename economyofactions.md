An interesting idea to avoid spammers is to make every action costly.

Each participants has some points, and every time they write a post or a comment a proposal he invests some points on it. Every time someone likes his idea, they add one point (out of their stack). Every time someone dislikes a post they steal one point from the stack.

Like this would not work. But maybe something more complex would. What is important is that a group of users are not allowed to just vote each other up, with the effect of producing more points
